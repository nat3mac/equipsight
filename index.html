	<h2 class="headline">Dirty Industries Are Here to Stay</h2>
	<p class="copy">Oil & gas extraction, chemical refining, and steel & cement manufacturing are the foundation of our
		modern world. However, these industries are also our biggest polluters. While intentional emissions get all the
		attention, unintentional emissions are a significant polluter.</p>
	<p class="copy">Unintentional losses from leaks and failures cost these industries billions in lost revenue. What if
		we can reduce these leaks while increasing bottom line? That's what EquipSight aims to do.</p>
	<p class="copy"><strong>Our AI-powered thermography system provides automatic continuous fault, trend, and failure
		monitoring on industrial machinery and equipment.</strong></p>

			<h3 class="benefits-item-heading">Reduce energy use through continuous monitoring</h3>
			<p class="copy">In fired heaters, small defects in the wall or refractory can go unnoticed, wasting fuel,
				driving up emissions, and releasing harmful fumes. The same is true across the plant. Equipment that’s
				starting to fail often runs hotter and may begin leaking process fluids or gases.</p>
			<p class="copy">Our system monitors both fixed equipment such as furnaces, heat exchangers, piping, and
				valves, and rotating equipment such as pumps, compressors, and motors. A thermal profile is built for
				each asset and our algorithm alerts when a deviation indicates a problem.</p>

			<h3 class="benefits-item-heading">Reduce emissions through leak detection</h3>
			<p class="copy">Leaky pipes and pumps leak chemicals into our environment and gasses into our
				atmosphere.</p>
			<p class="copy">Our system monitors pipes for leaks or bursts and pumps for operating temperature
				irregularities that indicate impending failure. When an alert comes through, maintenance can step in
				early, plan the repair, and prevent a failure before it turns into unplanned downtime.</p>
